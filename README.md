The IARA Information System is a project aimed at managing the business processes of the Executive Agency for Fisheries and Aquaculture (IARA) and facilitating its interactions with various stakeholders. This system encompasses multiple areas of data management, including registers, permits, tickets, inspections, and more. The primary goal is to streamline operations and improve efficiency within the organization.

## Project Description

The IARA system comprises several key components:

1. **Register Management:** The system allows for the organization and maintenance of data related to different permits, certificates, and objects. For example, it includes a register of fishing vessels in Bulgaria, which contains information on authorized vessels. Each ship is identified by an international number, call sign, and marking. Details of ship owners, the ship's master, and technical parameters (length, width, tonnage, draft, engine power, fuel, etc.) are also stored.

2. **Fishing Permits:** The system stores data on fishing permits. Fishing vessels can only engage in fishing activities if a valid permit has been issued to the owner or user of the vessel. These permits are issued annually and remain valid until a specified date. Violations can result in permit revocation. The permits outline the equipment to be used for fishing, the captain's information, and details about fishing trips.

3. **Electronic Logbook:** Every large vessel (over 10m) is required to submit an electronic logbook of fishing operations. The logbook records information such as the start time and location of fishing, duration of fishing, equipment used, and quantities of fish caught. A comprehensive history of landed fish and its journey to stores is maintained. Inspectors can verify compliance with requirements and permits by conducting inspections on stores, refrigerated trucks, and fishing vessels. Inspectors have access to tablets and a mobile application to document their inspections and issue acts and fines for violations.

4. **Recreational Fishing Tickets:** Another significant aspect of IARA's activities is the issuance of tickets for recreational fishing. Amateurs can purchase tickets through the website or mobile application. The application allows users to log their catch and verify the validity of their ticket during inspections. Ticket prices vary based on the validity period and the age or pensioner status of the individual. Disabled individuals can obtain a free ticket by submitting their TELK decision number.
